            "text": "PART ONEBrad Young, a lawyer at TripAdvisor, arrived at the company\u2019s offices in Needham, Massachusetts, on October 12, 2015, to find an email from his boss, Seth Kalvert, the company\u2019s general counsel. In itself that wasn\u2019t strange. As a travel site built on crowdsourced wisdom, where hundreds of millions of ordinary people post reviews and rate businesses, TripAdvisor is susceptible to fakery meant to inflate the ranking of a so-so restaurant or stain the reputation of a storied hotel. Young oversaw a group responsible for fending off these efforts, so he frequently got questions from Kalvert about con artists, cunning new deceits, and other shady corners of the law. But this email was different. Kalvert\u2019s wife had received a robocall offering an exclusive vacation deal as a reward for her loyal accumulation of \u201cTrip\u00adAdvisor credits.\u201d That would have been nice if TripAdvisor credits were a thing, but they weren\u2019t. The call was also odd because TripAdvisor didn\u2019t engage in telemarketing, much less robocalling. Kalvert wanted Young to look into it.Related StoriesLily Hay NewmanThe Robocall Nightmare Is Only Getting Worse\u2014But Help Is HereLily Hay NewmanNigerian Email Scammers Are More Effective Than EverElizabeth WeilThe Curse of the Bahia Emerald, a Giant Green Rock That Ruins LivesThe anti-fraud team was, in Young\u2019s words, \u201cthe company\u2019s secret sauce,\u201d adept at tackling every deception the internet had to offer. But the hustle meant to entice Kalvert\u2019s wife relied on old-school telephony. Cracking it would require an unusual set of skills. Luckily, Young knew just the person to turn to.Fred Garvin had joined TripAdvisor\u2019s anti-fraud team eight years earlier. He\u2019d been employed in a series of short-term jobs: mechanic, audio editor, anything that seemed interesting enough to hold his attention for a while. He was out of work when a friend saw an opening for a content moderator at TripAdvisor and urged Garvin to apply. He worked at home for a while, under the radar, but pretty soon managers started noticing his obsessive streak and a knack for what he called \u201cresearch.\u201d As a kid growing up in a small New England town in the pre-internet era, he\u2019d tracked down the addresses of celebrities so that he could request an autograph; he got a postcard signed by the B-52s and one from Mr. Bill, a famous Saturday Night Live character from the 1970s. (The name \u201cFred Garvin\u201d is another SNL reference, one of several professional aliases he adopted to protect his identity from the scammers and fraudsters he chases. It comes from an old sketch with Dan Aykroyd as Fred Garvin, male prostitute.) Garvin\u2019s manager recommended him for a position with the anti-fraud team. \u201cHe\u2019s the most cynical person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will question everything.\u201d He was a perfect fit.Young asked Garvin to look into the suspicious phone call. He said he figured it was probably the work of \u201csome two-bit hustler\u201d and wouldn\u2019t take long to sort out. Garvin, though, had only one phone call to go on, and a simple question: Who was on the other end of the line?Molly MendozaPART TWOBefore Young tasked him with running down the robocaller, Garvin had not taken much interest in the practice. Robocalls have been around since at least the 1980s, when someone first thought to attach a tape deck to a phone. In the analog age, the hardware was clunky, expensive, and difficult to operate. The tapes had to be rewound, and they eventually wore out. Still, the technology improved, and telemarketers kept promoting their wares. By the early 1990s, Americans were so sick of telemarketers and prerecorded messages that when US senator Fritz Hollings lamented on the Senate floor that the calls were \u201cthe scourge of modern civilization,\u201d few challenged the assertion, despite the competing scourges of war, say, or the spread of AIDS.Hollings was the sponsor of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and he seemed to draw upon personal experience during the legislative debate on the bill: Automated calls \u201cwake us up in the morning, they interrupt our dinner at night, they force the sick and elderly out of bed, they hound us until we want to rip the telephone right out of the wall.\u201d The law was signed by George H. W. Bush in 1991 and limited how and when telemarketers could place calls, focusing mostly on landlines, the dominant technology of the time. Cell phones, still relatively new, were treated like emergency lines and bestowed with special protection.Then over the next two decades came the internet, cheap data, voice-over-internet protocol, and the deregulation of the telecommunications industry\u2014all a boon to consumers and robocallers alike. Even big, well-known companies got in on it, launching robocall campaigns as a form of mass marketing on the cheap.Not surprisingly, people complained about being inundated with calls, and in 2009 the Federal Trade Commission enacted the \u201crobocall rule,\u201d which banned most pre\u00adrecorded telemarketing calls. There were exceptions, though, for things like political campaigns, charities, and debt collection, meaning your bank can still pester you about unpaid bills and candidates can beg for your vote.But the law was quickly outpaced and overshadowed by the rapid evolution in technology. Today, a single person in a modestly equipped office can make millions of calls a day by renting some server space, installing off-the-shelf autodialing software, and paying a VoIP provider to transmit calls. Some of the software is open source, and VoIP carriers often advertise a month of free service as a way to entice potential customers. Software companies offer everything you need in one package\u2014a robocall starter kit, available for anyone to buy.Best of all, it\u2019s cheap: VoIP services cost three-fifths of a penny per minute, and that\u2019s only if the call is answered. Unscrupulous carriers openly advertise their services to those looking to make \u201cdialer/short duration termination calls\u201d\u2014the jargony euphemism for robocalls\u2014and databases of consumer phone numbers are easy to buy. \u201cThe technology has gotten so inexpensive that any person can become a robocaller overnight,\u201d says Ian Barlow, who coordinates the FTC\u2019s Do Not Call program. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, it\u2019s accessible, and there are no barriers to entry.\u201d Once the software has been programmed to control who to call and when, the robocaller doesn\u2019t even need to press a button to start making calls each morning. The same technology also makes scammers hard to identify and track down.Little wonder, then, that the United States is awash in robocalls. According to YouMail, a maker of robocall-blocking software, Americans received a record-breaking 47.8 billion robocalls in 2018 . That works out to nearly 200 per year for every adult. Unwanted calls are the most common consumer complaint lodged with the Federal Communications Commission, and the trend shows no signs of slowing, despite the pile-on of laws and regulations\u2014the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Truth in Caller ID Act, and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, among others\u2014outlawing the vast majority of auto\u00addialed calls or prerecorded messages, at least those used for marketing purposes. With more than 100 million calls placed every day, robocalling might well be the most ubiquitous, most hated, and least punished crime in the country.Garvin set up shop in a quiet corner on the third floor of TripAdvisor\u2019s headquarters, flanked by whiteboards and a bay of screens, preparing to track down the mystery robocaller. Garvin is in his early forties, with dark, spiky hair, a soft face, and darting eyes. In conversation, he is calm and self-possessed, even formal, but he buzzes with a tightly wound energy.Garvin scoured the web, looking through blogs, forums, and social media for any mention of a similar call. He didn\u2019t have to look very far. Dozens of people were grumbling\u2014or worse\u2014on TripAdvisor\u2019s own forums. \u201cIF I EVER GET A CALL LIKE THAT AGAIN, I WILL CONTACT THE FCC AND I WILL OPEN THE GATES OF HELL ON TRIP ADVISORS,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cNEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER CALL ME LIKE THAT AGAIN. EVER. GOT IT.\u201dOne of his early gambits was simply calling a number that had placed a robocall. When he tried that, though, he found a human on the other end of the line, perplexed as to how their phone number had been used for prerecorded marketing. Eventually he figured out that the robocaller was engaging in a practice called neighbor spoofing\u2014making the calls look as if they were coming from someone living near the intended recipient. For Garvin, it was a dead end.Hoping he might get lucky and receive one of the robocalls himself, Garvin began answering every suspicious call and spoofed number that lit up his cell phone. He heard dubious alerts about student loan forgiveness, unclaimed lottery windfalls, and tax debt. \u201cI was the only person you will ever meet who was excited to receive a robocall,\u201d he says. He was getting several a day and answering as many as he could, all the while hoping for one that would lead back to the TripAdvisor scam.The irate stories on TripAdvisor forums seemed like promising leads, except that the details didn\u2019t line up. People who got the same prerecorded pitch on the same day were transferred to live operators who offered different vacation packages at different prices. Garvin and Young felt as if they were \u201cchasing ghosts,\u201d Young said.SIGN UP TODAYSign up for the Daily newsletter and never miss the best of WIRED.Those posts did offer a few clues: The calls came over VoIP and seemed to be a classic bait and switch. If you were on the line, you\u2019d hear a recorded female voice saying that you\u2019d received TripAdvisor credits that could be redeemed for a vacation. The \u201ccredits\u201d might be for $999 or $2,000\u2014the amounts differed\u2014but you\u2019d be instructed to press 1 to take advantage of the incredible offer and then be transferred to a live operator. Neither the credits nor the name Trip\u00adAdvisor would be mentioned again. Instead, the operator would pitch an unrelated offer: a cruise, a resort, an all-inclusive stay at a beachfront hotel.Drawing from angry postings and tips on the TripAdvisor forums, Garvin put together a list of all the companies pitching their wares through the fraudulent robocall. He checked the domain registrations and IP addresses of their websites and realized that they all had identical content, shared web hosting servers, and listed the same contact information. They all showed the same white sand beaches and featured images of the same beautiful, sun-dappled tourists. And they all traced back to the Yucat\u00e1n. Cutting and pasting in Google Translate, Garvin trawled through Mexican business registration documents, time-share websites, and social media postings, mapping out an ecosystem of companies\u2014some legitimate, some less so\u2014that he had never known existed. Now, he thought, he was getting somewhere.His internet wanderings led to a booming call-center industry in Canc\u00fan and surrounding areas connecting American customers with local time-share and resort companies. If these centers were involved in the robocall trade, Garvin wanted to learn as much about them as he could.Facebook proved a useful investigative tool. One employee posted a photograph of himself posing in the call center. On the wall behind him was a piece of paper listing some sort of information. Garvin zoomed in and could just make out the business name and website address that the center\u2019s operators were to use that day\u2014a lead for observing the scammers in real time. Over the following months, Garvin watched on Facebook as the man in the photo transitioned from employee to manager to entrepreneur, posting ads soliciting staff for his own newly opened call center. Garvin was down the rabbit hole now, snooping from afar on individual employees as they went about their business. He wasn\u2019t sure if these call centers were the ones responsible for the TripAdvisor scam, but the only way to find out was to keep tracking them.Garvin picked up another clue: TripAdvisor was not the only brand being flogged. The calls also touted exclusive deals for loyal customers of Marriott, Hilton, and Expedia\u2014a \u201cwho\u2019s-who of travel companies,\u201d Young says, none of which were actually offering the deals. In his conversations with jilted customers, Garvin found that the trips on offer were probably real but difficult to redeem. When someone tried to book a trip they had purchased, suddenly there were no dates available, or the contact information the business had provided was invalid. The customers who made it through that gauntlet were welcomed to their vacation destinations with long sales pitches for expensive local time-shares. The brand names had drawn people in. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t just say, \u2018Hey, you interested in a very questionable Mexican time-share situation?\u2019\u2009\u201d Garvin says.Garvin managed to recruit some of the irate customers into his army of amateur sleuths. One woman, a nurse from Massachusetts named Kim, was getting 10 or more calls a day for months on end. \u201cI was, oh, I was beyond, beyond irritated,\u201d she says. Finally, fed up, she found the phone number for TripAdvisor\u2019s president and CEO and called to complain. He called right back. \u201cThis is not us,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis is somebody pretending to be us.\u201d Then he put her in touch with Garvin, so he could debrief her and add the phone numbers she\u2019d collected to his own burgeoning database.The investigation was moving along. Young and Garvin, along with Amy Rubin, an attorney who was the third constant member of the investigation team, were starting to see where the calls ended up and how people were getting scammed. But they still didn\u2019t know who was making the robocalls\u2014or how to stop them. After more than three months of digging, they decided to ask for help.Molly MendozaPART THREEIn April of 2016, Young flew to Washington, DC, to meet with Kristi Thompson, deputy chief of the Enforcement Bureau at the FCC\u2019s Telecommunications Consumers Division. Young had pulled together the information that he and Garvin had been gathering, hoping to persuade the FCC to get involved in the hunt. He was surprised when, almost as soon as he began speaking, he says, \u201cthere was visible excitement throughout the room.\u201dThe FCC was chasing the same scammers. A few months earlier a medical paging company called Spok had come to the agency for help; a sudden influx of robocalls was flooding the company\u2019s network. Pagers may seem like an anachronism, but they are still used by more than 80 percent of hospitals. Whoever was behind the TripAdvisor robocall campaign had inadvertently debilitated Spok\u2019s networks by flooding pagers with digital messages they weren\u2019t equipped to handle. Emergency room doctors, nurses, and first responders were getting delayed alerts. This was not just an annoyance; it was a matter of life and death.Thompson\u2019s team already had an idea where the calls were coming from. TripAdvisor \u201cgave us the content of the messages, and the \u2018why,\u2019 \u201d an FCC official who worked on the case says. \u201cWe knew the \u2018what,\u2019 but we couldn\u2019t see inside the messages like they could.\u201dYoung returned to TripAdvisor headquarters feeling buoyed. Garvin soon came to him with another reason to celebrate. On July 29 he had driven to his sister-in-law\u2019s house and was chatting in the front yard about dinner plans when his phone rang. Garvin saw a spoofed number and had an intuition. His sister-in-law was midsentence when Garvin blurted, \u201cI have to go.\u201d He sprinted to his car, grabbed a notebook, and picked up the call.\u201cThis is TripAdvisor,\u201d a chipper automated female voice said, and today was Garvin\u2019s lucky day: He\u2019d been awarded thousands of TripAdvisor credits for an exclusive vacation to the sunny Caribbean!It was Garvin\u2019s lucky day. He\u2019d been collecting information for more than nine months, but everything he knew was secondhand. He had never heard the messages himself or been able to tie the Mexican resorts directly to the call centers and the fraudulent use of TripAdvisor\u2019s name. Earlier in the summer, the complaints seemed to have stopped, and Garvin worried that the scammers had gone dark before he could pin them down. Now they were calling his cell phone.Following the prompts, Garvin was transferred to a live agent, who asked his age range and if he made at least $60,000 a year. He passed the test and was quickly put on the line with a second live agent\u2014the charmer. \u201cYou\u2019ve won an all-inclusive trip to one of our fabulous resorts,\u201d the agent said. \u201cWhat do you like to do on vacation, Mr. Garvin?\u201dGarvin played along. \u201cI like to hang out by the pool and have a few cocktails,\u201d he said. Garvin did his best to maintain his composure as he sat in his car scribbling and trying to eke out company names and information from the agent. His sister-in-law had long since given up and gone inside.When the agent sensed that the hook was in, he went in for the close: \u201cThis trip is valued at $4,000, but today it\u2019s only $999. We accept Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Which card would you like to use today?\u201dGarvin deflected. \u201cIf I make this purchase without asking my wife, I\u2019m in the doghouse,\u201d he told the agent. \u201cIt\u2019s better to ask for forgiveness than permission,\u201d the operator replied. Still, he gave Garvin a callback number and other information. When Garvin hung up, he drove home as fast as he could. Armed with new websites and names, he spent all night at his laptop. By the next morning, after sleuthing through social media and Mexican phone databases, he knew the real name of the call center agent and found the Facebook page of the call center\u2019s CEO\u2014people he could tie directly to the TripAdvisor scam. Now they had the evidence they needed to bring a full dossier to the FCC.As Garvin gathered information about call centers in Mexico, Young began sending them cease and desist letters, explaining that TripAdvisor had learned of their ploy and threatening to turn them in to Mexican authorities. Most just ignored him or pleaded ignorance. Finally, one company\u2014seeking to demonstrate its good intentions (or avoid a lawsuit)\u2014offered up a key piece of information. Garvin and Young had assumed that the Mexican call centers were making the robocalls themselves. But they weren\u2019t. They paid someone in the US to do that. Best of all, the newly solicitous Mexican company knew the first name and phone number of their American robocaller.Young contacted Thompson at the FCC again. \u201cLet\u2019s have another meeting,\u201d he said. With the first name, phone number, and some googling they had found their man: Adrian Abramovich.PART FOUROn April 18, 2018, Adrian Abramovich appeared before the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Ten months earlier, with help from Garvin and Young, the FCC had accused him of a \u201cmassive caller ID spoofing operation\u201d and slapped him with a proposed $120 million fine, then the largest in the history of the FCC. The agency identified Abramovich as the source of 96,758,223 illegal robocalls. The laws governing robocalls are complex and sometimes contradictory, enforced by multiple agencies, and with layers of exceptions and loopholes. But the gist is simple enough: no calling cell phones, no using automated or prerecorded messages, and no using fake names or numbers. According to the FCC, Abramovich had broken all of these rules.Abramovich arrived at the Russell Senate Office Building looking bewildered, as you might expect of someone compelled by congressional subpoena. In the past few years, there hadn\u2019t been much that Democrats and Republicans in Congress could agree on. Health care, immigration, taxes, deficits\u2014every debate, every topic and idea was us vs. them. Here, finally, was an issue that perfectly bridged the partisan divide: a burning hatred of robo\u00adcalls. As soon as the hearing began, the senators pounced, clearly relishing the chance to lay into the stout man at the witness table. Abramovich, wearing a suit and glasses and with his hair pulled back into a neat man bun, looked trapped. Senator Richard Blumenthal kicked things off. Abramovich, Blumenthal said, had assembled a \u201cphenomenal record of consumer abuse.\u201d Looking directly at him, he declared: \u201cYou have become the face of this problem.\u201dThough Abramovich refused to talk about his own actions, he insisted that all of the vacation packages were on the up-and-up and that no consumers were misled. Sure, the calls were actually just the entr\u00e9e to find customers for expensive time-shares, but it was all there in the fine print of the deals. (The FCC was only interested in the robocalling violations, not whether the trips themselves were scams.) Besides, he was just the middleman, connecting American consumers to Mexican companies. As the questioning continued, Abramovich took great care to distinguish the \u201cgood guy\u201d robocallers like himself, who were offering \u201clegitimate services or products,\u201d from the true scam artists. \u201cI receive four or five robocalls a day,\u201d he added, as if to give his Everyman bona fides. \u201cI never answer the phone.\u201d These replies elicited little sympathy from the senators. \u201cThe efficiency and the magnitude of your robocall campaign is truly historic,\u201d said Senator Ed Markey, who pointed out that he had written the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, one of the laws that Abramovich was accused of violating. \u201cDo you understand why it irritates people? Do you understand why they don\u2019t want these unwanted calls, Mr. Abramovich?\u201dIt went on like that: 45 minutes of US senators scolding the seemingly baffled kingpin of robocalling.Molly MendozaPART FIVEI found Abramovich the same way he probably found the people he autodialed: through a public database listing his name, phone number, and home address. He lives in a posh Miami neighborhood in a gated oceanside community with the requisite pool, tennis courts, and security guards. The large stone-and-brick villas are organized around handsome courtyards with palm trees planted in the middle.I knocked on the door, unannounced. Abramovich answered in a tight Lacoste T-shirt and skinny distressed jeans, and I thrust my hand out before he could shut the door. We stood in the doorway talking for half an hour until Abramovich\u2019s wife joined us and invited me in.Abramovich has a thing for bad guys. His man cave, which doubles as a home office, is decorated with figurines, paintings, and memorabilia depicting infamous movie villains like Scarface, the mobsters from Goodfellas, and Freddy Krueger. A record collection lines one wall, and an 80-inch TV is positioned in front of a set of plush black chairs and a black couch. Beside the record collection is his desk. Here it was: the compact headquarters of an alleged robocall empire from which Abramovich was said to place millions of calls a day. Off-the-shelf software can run automatically, moving through lists of phone numbers and other personal data available for purchase. The only limit to a robocall business is the amount of bandwidth you\u2019re willing to pay for; the potential number of calls Abramovich could have made was unlimited.As we toured the house, Abramovich\u2019s wife pointed to their collection of South American art, while her husband described his current predicament with a sullen, dejected air, all sighs and slow head shakes. Despite the surroundings, he protested that his work had not made him rich\u2014there was no way he could pay the $120 million fine or even a fraction of it. \u201cI\u2019m on monthly payment plans for everything,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to find a boat or five condos anywhere.\u201d His wife, while keeping the family\u2019s three small dogs at bay, noted, unprompted, that the Ferrari in the garage had been purchased in 2010 and was paid off in installments over five years.Abramovich talked about a lot of things: Senator John Thune\u2019s height (shorter than you\u2019d think from TV), infamous pharma bro Martin Shkreli. (\u201cHe was laughing in front of the Senate. I was scared. I was really scared.\u201d) But he mostly wanted to vent. After the FCC\u2019s citation, his home had been inundated with hate mail and angry phone calls; his bank had closed his account without explanation and refused to let him open a new one. Family members had stopped talking to him.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Personal DataThe humiliating spotlight of national condemnation came as a shock to him. He had immigrated to the US from Argentina\u2014he still speaks with a thick accent\u2014and over the past two decades, he has formed and led at least 12 corporations in Florida, according to the FCC, most of them dedicated to telemarketing and travel deals.For all those years, calling maybe billions of people, he had been hidden from consumer anger and opprobrium. His prolific telemarketing got him into trouble in 2007 when AT&T Mobility got a consent judgment and injunction against him for unlawful telemarketing, but it wasn\u2019t big news. The FCC ordeal was something entirely new and unpleasant.The worst part, he said, was being served the Senate subpoena. It was Good Friday, and he was at his lawyer\u2019s office talking about the case. His youngest daughter, barely a teenager, answered the door before his wife intervened. When a US marshal tried to hand Abramovich\u2019s wife the subpoena, she let the papers drop to the ground. \u201cYou haven\u2019t served me anything,\u201d she said. The following Tuesday, three cars came screeching into their home\u2019s shared courtyard, sirens blazing, and five marshals came to the door with the subpoena, Abramovich said. The neighbors came out to gawk. (The US Marshals Service said the subpoena was served \u201cin a lawful manner.\u201d)People didn\u2019t know his side of the story, Abramovich protested, but they had already decided that he was the bad guy. Abramovich told me that his lawyer had advised him not to talk to anyone, and he wavered as we spoke, alternating between brash defiance and victimhood. The case was now in the hands of the local US attorney, who was responsible for collecting the FCC\u2019s judgment. The prosecutor hadn\u2019t filed a complaint yet, but Abramovich, who has denied any intent to defraud customers, was planning to defend himself in court and then plead down to a lesser settle\u00adment based on his inability to pay the full fine. No matter what amount the settlement reached, though, he still felt wronged. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t care.\u201d Then he asked me to leave.Molly MendozaPART SIXEven with Abramovich out of the game, the number of robocalls continues to explode. Many calls are from big companies doing what\u2019s allowed (like dunning their customers), and some are from big companies doing what\u2019s not (Dish Network was ordered to pay $280 million in 2017 for making calls to numbers on the Do Not Call Registry). And the netherworld of scammers keeps growing. Shady new kingpins are always popping up, eager to make their fortune. The FCC acknowledges that it is fighting a losing battle. By the end of this year, according to First Orion, a maker of caller ID and call-blocking software, nearly half of all telephone traffic in the US will be spam calls. \u201cGoing after a single bad actor is like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon,\u201d one FCC commissioner wrote in her opinion commending the fine against Abramovich. \u201cAnd right now we\u2019re all wet.\u201dMore than three years on, Garvin is still tracking robocalls. His methods now include fake credit card numbers, burner email addresses, even tricks for inducing a call center operator to text him from a personal number. He still trawls the TripAdvisor forums for complaints. Sometimes the work relates to an ongoing investigation for TripAdvisor; more often, it\u2019s just to scratch his own itch.One of the jobs that Garvin held before Trip\u00adAdvisor was editing audio for a SpongeBob SquarePants videogame. Listening to hours of dialog, he developed a knack for recognizing voices. Garvin thinks he has identified five or six voices that pop up again and again on the robocalls he\u2019s listened to\u2014and he\u2019s listened to thousands. He has a new idea: What if he could figure out the identities of those people and uncover the marketplace where robocallers find and hire voice actors? Could he nip a campaign in the bud? Better yet, what if, rather than ignoring robocalls, every American answered every call? If enough people pressed through to the call-center agents and toyed with them for hours, the enterprises would be deprived of sales and the robocallers driven into oblivion!That\u2019s a crazy idea. Even Garvin knows it. And it directly contradicts one of the FTC\u2019s recommendations to consumers: When you receive a robocall, just hang up; do not engage. But the idea appeals to Garvin\u2019s mischievous side, his fondness for turning the tables on scammers. For the time being, he is content finding angry customers, getting as much information from them as he can, and forwarding it all to the FCC for follow-up and prosecution. Recently, he bought four phones for the exclusive purpose of receiving robocalls. They are still ringing.Alex W.

            "text": "Widespread adoption of the web encryption scheme HTTPS has added a lot of green padlocks\u2014and corresponding data protection\u2014to the web. All of the popular sites you visit every day likely offer this defense, called Transport Layer Security, or TLS, which encrypts data between your browser and the web servers it communicates with to protect your travel plans, passwords, and embarrassing Google searches from prying eyes. But new findings from researchers at Ca' Foscari University of Venice in Italy and Tu Wien in Austria indicate that a surprising number of encrypted sites still leave these connections exposed.In analysis of the web's top 10,000 HTTPS sites\u2014as ranked by Amazon-owned analytics company Alexa\u2014the researchers found that 5.5 percent had potentially exploitable TLS vulnerabilities. These flaws were caused by a combination of issues in how sites implemented TLS encryption schemes and failures to patch known bugs, (of which there are many) in TLS and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer. But the worst thing about these flaws is they are subtle enough that the green padlock will still appear.\"We assume in the paper that the browser is up to date, but the things that we found are not spotted by the browser,\" says Riccardo Focardi, a network security and cryptography researcher at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, who also cofounded the auditing firm Cryptosense. \"These are things that are not fixed and are not even noticed. We wanted to identify these problems with sites' TLS that are not yet pointed out on the user side.\"The researchers, who will present their full findings at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, to be held in May in San Francisco, developed TLS analysis techniques and also used some from existing cryptographic literature to crawl and vet the top 10,000 sites for TLS issues. And they developed three categories for the types of vulnerabilities found.Lily Hay Newman covers information security, digital privacy, and hacking for WIRED.Some flaws represent a risk, but would be difficult for an attacker to rely on alone, because they involve initiating the same query multiple times to slowly extrapolate information from small tells. These \"partially leaky\" bugs might help an attacker decrypt something like a session cookie, since the cookie is likely sent along with every site query, but they would be less effective for grabbing, say, passwords that a user generally only sends once in a given session.The other two categories are more sinister. Vulnerabilities that are full-on \"leaky\" involve more deeply flawed encryption channels between browsers and web servers that would enable an attacker to decrypt all the traffic passing through them. Worst of all are the \"tainted\" channels the researchers observed that would potentially allow an attacker to not only decrypt traffic, but also modify or manipulate it. These are the kinds of \"man in the middle\" attacks that HTTPS encryption was precisely created to defeat.In practice, the flaws the researchers found are not necessarily critical vulnerabilities, according to Kenn White, a security engineer and director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. Many of them are potentially exploitable, but might not be appealing targets for hackers, because they would take more effort and be more conspicuous to abuse in an attack than other common vulnerabilities. But he emphasizes that the findings are still important as part of larger initiatives to clean up the web.\"While 'don't handle cookies on your web server like it's 2005' and 'use decent TLS' is sort of obvious, this research highlights that those basic things are still a struggle for a surprisingly large number of high-traffic sites,\" White says. \"It's vital that web developers employ modern HTTP antitampering techniques.\"\"On the web you have a lot of dependencies and relationships between URLs and hosts that can produce an amplification of a TLS vulnerability.\"Riccardo Focardi, Ca' Foscari UniversityThe researchers say that beyond specific assessments of how many sites have TLS vulnerabilities, a crucial concept in this project has to do with the fundamental interconnectedness of the web and how small TLS flaws on one page have potential ramifications for many others. Example.com's homepage may have have solid HTTPS, but if mail.example.com has problems and the two interact, the encrypted connections between them will be undermined.\"When you have domains that are related to each other, sensitive data and things like cookies may be shared between them, which means that when one of the hosts is weak the vulnerability may propagate,\" Ca' Foscari's Focardi says. \"On the web you have a lot of dependencies and relationships between URLs and hosts that can produce an amplification of a TLS vulnerability.\"The researchers identified almost 91,000 related domains that are either subdomains of or share resources with the top 10,000 sites. TLS vulnerabilities in these dependent sites could create a ripple of exposure in the overall population. So the 5.5 percent of the top 10,000 sites that have flaws actually comes from 292 of the top 10,000 sites that have direct TLS vulnerabilities and 5,282 related sites that, through their own TLS bugs, create potential exposures for the main 10,000. Of this total, more than 4,800 of the flaws are the most severe \"tainted\" vulnerabilities, 733 are the \"leaky\" bugs that allow for decryption but not manipulation, and 912 are the lower-severity \"partially leaky\" bugs.The idea that interdependencies can create vulnerabilities is well known in web security research\u2014it essentially boils down to \"you're only as strong as your weakest link.\" And the findings from Ca' Foscari fit into a broader body of research looking at how to detect and mitigate these types of exposures. The Ca' Foscari researchers say they are working to develop a tool based on their findings that can help developers identify frequently overlooked TLS vulnerabilities.Given that the whole point of the web is interconnectivity at a massive scale, it's increasingly vital to be able to catch small oversights and weaknesses that could have an outsize impact on overall security.More Great WIRED StoriesHow much prenatal genetic info do you really want?On the trail of the robocall kingThe real choice you make subscribing to Apple servicesThe mathematical history of a perfect color combinationFor gig workers, client interactions can get \u2026 weird\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

            "text": "Ransomware has long been the scourge of the cybersecurity industry. When that extortionate hacking goes beyond encrypting files to fully paralyze computers across a company, it represents not just a mere shakedown, but a crippling disruption. Now a nasty new breed of ransomware known as LockerGoga is inflicting that paralysis on industrial firms whose computers control actual physical equipment, and it's enough to deeply spook security researchers.Since the beginning of the year, LockerGoga has hit a series of industrial and manufacturing firms with apparently catastrophic consequences: After an initial infection at the French engineering consulting firm Altran, LockerGoga last week slammed Norwegian aluminum manufacturer Norsk Hydro, forcing some of the company's aluminum plants to switch to manual operations. Two more manufacturing companies, Hexion and Momentive, have been hit by LockerGoga\u2014in Momentive's case leading to a \"global IT outage,\" according to a report Friday by Motherboard. And incident responders at security firm FireEye tell WIRED they've dealt with multiple LockerGoga attacks on other industrial and manufacturing targets they declined to name, which would put the total number of victims in that sector at five or more.Andy Greenberg is a WIRED security writer and author of the forthcoming book, Sandworm: A New Era of Cyberwar and the Hunt for the Kremlin's Most Dangerous Hackers.Security researchers also say that the most recently discovered strain of the malware is particularly disruptive, shutting down computers entirely, locking out their users, and rendering it difficult for victims to even pay the ransom. The result is a dangerous combination: reckless hacking that targets a set of companies that are highly incentivized to quickly pay the ransom, but also ones where a cyberattack could wind up physically harming equipment or even a factory's staff.\"If you cripple the ability to operate an industrial environment, you\u2019re costing that enterprise significant amounts of money and really applying pressure for every minute that loss of control continues,\" says Joe Slowik, a researcher at the security firm Dragos, which focuses on industrial control systems. \"Unless that system is in a steady state of operation or has good physical fail-safes, you now have a process out of your control and out of view of your own eyes. That makes this extremely irresponsible and very nasty.\"Anatomy of an ExtortionLockerGoga, which was named for a file path in its source code by security research group MalwareHunterTeam, remains relatively rare and targeted compared with older forms of ransomware like SamSam and Ryuk, says Charles Carmakal, who leads a team of incident responders at FireEye that has dealt with multiple infestations. FireEye, for instance, has seen fewer than 10 victims, though MalwareHunterTeam estimates the total victim count in the dozens. It's not clear how the LockerGoga hackers are gaining initial access to victim networks in those targeted cases, but Carmakal has found that they seem to already know targets' credentials at the start of an intrusion, perhaps thanks to phishing attacks or by simply buying them from other hackers. Once the intruders have an initial foothold, they use the common hacking toolkits Metasploit and Cobalt Strike to move to other computers on the network and also exploit the program Mimikatz, which can pull traces of passwords out of the memory of Windows machines and allow them to gain access to more privileged accounts.After they obtain a network's highest privilege \"domain admin\" credentials, they use Microsoft's Active Directory management tools to plant their ransomware payload on target machines across the victim's systems. That code, Carmakal says, is signed with stolen certificates that make it look more legitimate. And before running their encryption code, the hackers use a \"task kill\" command on target machines to disable their antivirus. Both of those measures have made antivirus particularly ineffective against the subsequent infections, he says. LockerGoga then rapidly encrypts the computer's files. \"On an average system within a few minutes, it is toast,\" wrote Kevin Beaumont, a UK security researcher, in an analysis of the Norsk Hydro attack.Finally, the hackers plant a readme file on the machine that lists their demands. \"Greetings! There was a significant flaw in the security system of your company,\" it reads. \"You should be thankful the flaw was exploited by serious people and not by some rookies. They would have damaged all your data by mistake or for fun.\" The note doesn't name a ransom price but instead provides email addresses, demanding the victim contact the hackers there to negotiate a bitcoin sum for the return of their systems, which according to FireEye are typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.Cruel and Unusual PunishmentIn the latest version of the malware that researchers have analyzed, LockerGoga goes further still: It also disables the computer's network adapter to disconnect it from the network, changes the user and admin passwords on the computer, and logs the machine off. Security researchers have found that in some cases, the victim can log back in with a particular password, \"HuHuHUHoHo283283@dJD,\" or with a cached domain password. But the result, even so, is that unlike more typical ransomware, the victim often can't even see the ransom message. In some cases, they may not even know that they've been hit with ransomware, delaying their ability to recover their systems or pay the extortionists, and causing even greater disruptions to their network.SIGN UP TODAYSign up for the Daily newsletter and never miss the best of WIRED.That's a very different approach from typical ransomware that merely encrypts some files on a machine but otherwise leaves it running, says Earl Carter, a researcher at Cisco's Talos division. The degree of disruption is counterproductive even for the hackers, since they're less likely to be paid, he argues. \"Everyone is kicked off the system so they can\u2019t even get back to look at the ransom note,\" he says. \"It throws everything into chaos. You\u2019ve just destroyed the operation of the system, so users can\u2019t do anything at all, which is a much more significant impact on the network\" than a typical ransomware attack.But FireEye's Carmakal insists that the LockerGoga hackers are nonetheless profit-focused, and not merely seeking to sow chaos. He says some victims have in fact paid six-figure ransoms and had their files returned. \"Quite frankly I question whether it's a deliberate design by the threat actor,\" Carmakal adds. \"Did they understand the consequences of how much more difficult it would be? Or did they want it this way? I really don't know.\"Industrial-Level PainFireEye notes that LockerGoga's victims aren't limited to industrial or manufacturing victims. Instead, the vicitims include \"targets of opportunity\" in other business sectors too\u2014any company that hackers believe will pay and for which they can gain an initial foothold. But the unusual number of crippled industrial firms LockerGoga has left in its wake, combined with its hyperaggressive effects, represent an especially serious risk, according to Dragos' Joe Slowik.Slowik warns that the more recent, disruptive form of the malware could easily infect the computers those firms use to control industrial equipment\u2014the so-called \"human-machine interface\" or HMI machines that run software sold by companies like Siemens and GE for remotely managing automated physical processes. In the worst-case scenario, the ransomware might paralyze those computers and lead to unsafe conditions or even industrial accidents.\"Doing something as indiscriminate and as thoroughly disruptive as what LockerGoga can do on industrial control devices is not good,\" says Slowik. \"You typically don't test these systems in a situation where your ability to control or monitor them is taken away from you. If anything changes, you're unable to react to it, and any situation that develops can become a crisis very quickly.\"One disturbing example of that nightmare scenario was a case that came to light in 2014 when a German steel mill was hit by unknown hackers. The attack, whether intentionally or not, prevented the plant's operators from shutting down a blast furnace, causing \"massive damage,\" according to a German government report on the incident, which didn't name the company involved.That sort of catastrophe, to be clear, is only a troubling edge case, Slowik notes. It's not yet clear if LockerGoga infected any of the industrial control systems of victims like Hexion, Norsk Hydro, or Momentive, rather than their traditional business IT networks. And even if it did infect those control systems, Slowik points out that industrial facilities implement both independent digital protections\u2014such as safety-instrumented systems that monitor unsafe conditions in a plant\u2014and physical fail-safes that could prevent a dangerous accident.But even so, if those sorts of fail-safes became necessary, they would still likely cause an emergency shutdown that itself would represent a serious, costly disruption for an industrial hacking victim\u2014likely one that's even worse than the kind LockerGoga's industrial victims are already facing. \"Nothing might have blown up, but it's not a trivial impact,\" Slowik says. \"You're still left with a situation where your plant is shut down, you have a significant recovery operation ahead of you, and you\u2019re losing money by the minute.

            "text": "Even when Mar\u00eda sleeps, she hears the voices.One at a time, they speak of chaos, hunger, confusion. As she dreams, she hears a familiar voice explain where you can still find certain medicines. This is the latest news from the US, says another. Run, run south right now, someone warns as calmly as they can. As Mar\u00eda makes lunch for her kids and drops them off at their school in Miami, the voices are in her ear. As she falls asleep next to her husband at night, they\u2019re there.The voices are those of Venezuelans, as well as of those among the Venezuelan diaspora, who for years have been engulfed by political and economic crisis under the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Nicolas Maduro. Thousands of them come together in Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos (Venezuela to the Marrow, or to the Bone), a channel Mar\u00eda runs on the popular voice-chat app Zello. As the Latin American country descends further into turmoil, her channel has become an essential lifeline for people in the country where Mar\u00eda was born and raised, and where she still has family. To protect her identity, WIRED is using only her first name.Mar\u00eda learned about Zello in 2014, when the app first emerged as a crucial tool for Venezuelans protesting widespread hunger and political oppression under Maduro\u2019s regime. She was already living in the US, and relied on the app to find out what was happening back home. She created Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos later that year. \u201cEver since, I have been on the app pretty much 24 hours a day,\u201d she says. She takes out her earphones to shower, and that\u2019s about it. \u201cAlways at least I am hearing. Sometimes I\u2019m speaking.\u201dEmily Dreyfuss covers the intersection of tech and culture for WIRED.Like a walkie-talkie, Zello allows one person to talk at a time, whether in private chats or on public channels that can function like CB radio. The way Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos is configured, only the moderators can speak; anyone else listening to the channel can ask them for permission to talk. Aside from Mar\u00eda, Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos has a dozen moderators. They take shifts so that the channel has someone speaking and listening to subscriber requests 24 hours a day. While sometimes the moderators let people speak directly on the channel, other times they pass on requests or questions or tidbits of information they receive from users, like radio hosts reading listener mail.\u201cPeople will come to our channel and say to us, \u2018I desperately need these pills for my mom,\u2019\u201d Mar\u00eda says. The moderators will put that plea out on the channel, and then hopefully someone else will privately tell them they have it. \u201cThen we will arrange for them to get it, and we make it so these people never actually need to meet each other.\u201dVenezuelans face an overwhelming shortage of medicine; in 2017, the country\u2019s pharmaceutical federation estimated 85 percent of medication needs were being unmet. While the Maduro government has refused foreign aid from a number of countries, including the US, Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos moderators have helped people find food and medical supplies, like hearing aids. They have warned people to keep their kids home from school on days when listeners report that the government is arresting people on the street.\u201cPeople will come to our channel and say to us, \u2018I desperately need these pills for my mom.\u2019\u201dMar\u00eda, Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanosPeople also tune in for access to news that isn\u2019t controlled by Maduro, which Mar\u00eda and the moderators read aloud throughout the day. \u201cThere is no true media down there,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything has been bought by the government and they broadcast whatever the government wants them to broadcast. So the people in Venezuela have no access to the truth, to what\u2019s going on even in their own state.\u201d Reporters Without Borders ranked Venezuela 143rd out of 180 countries in its 2018 World Press Freedom Index. Economic and political pressures have forced many independent outlets to shut down. When the country\u2019s largest remaining antigovernment newspaper shuttered last year, its journalists said the government had made it impossible to get enough paper to print.Venezuelans turn to Zello, according to Mar\u00eda, to fill the gaps. Since January 23, when opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself the rightful president of Venezuela, downloads of the app inside the country have increased 135 percent, Zello says. Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos has more than 71,000 subscribers; Zello reports it is the largest channel there.Bill Moore, the CEO of Zello, says he's very conscious of the role his app plays in situations like those in Venezuela. The Austin-based company was founded in 2012 on the idea that the human voice is the best, simplest, and most direct way to convey information, and that the internet could make push-to-talk communication more accessible. Over the years, the truth of that premise has often shown up during times of crisis. \u201cOur voice instantly carries a huge amount of information,\u201d Moore adds. \u201cParticularly when stakes are high and when there\u2019s an emergency, you can organize a lot of people at once using your voice.\u201dToday, Zello has 133 million registered users around the world. Most of them use the app for free; the company makes its money from a paid service, ZelloWork, used by businesses such as trucking and construction companies. The app does require an internet or cellular data connection, but because it is built to have a small data load\u2014no videos or large files can be shared on the channels, and only one voice speaking at once\u2014it can often work even with a poor connection, when other apps and services might not load.\u201cParticularly when stakes are high and when there\u2019s an emergency, you can organize a lot of people at once using your voice.\u201dBill Moore, Zello CEOZello has been been a popular app during hurricanes and other natural disasters. It briefly topped Apple\u2019s App Store charts in the US as Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida in 2017. After a devastating earthquake in Mexico that same year, rescue workers relied on Zello to coordinate operations.What's more, Zello has a number of other features that make it attractive for organizers like Mar\u00eda. Any voice data shared in private channels or directly between two users is end-to-end encrypted, as is text information. Though the app requires people to give a username and email at sign-up, it does not require those to be real names. And the app keeps no logs of the voice or text data that is sent over its lines, public or private.Anyone can tune into public channels like Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos, which makes it useful for reaching large audiences\u2014but it also means government officials can listen in too. Anonymity on Zello is crucial. The Maduro government can and does listen, according to Mar\u00eda and Zello junior data analyst Alejandra Garc\u00eda Buenaventura, who has worked with Mar\u00eda and her channel to ensure people can safely use the app.\u201cThe moderators have gotten really good at not using private information,\u201d Garc\u00eda says. \u201cWhen you go to the channel, they are not giving any clues of where they are.\u201dGarc\u00eda has taken the lead in studying how Venezuelans and other at-risk communities use Zello and making sure Zello\u2019s 40-person staff in Austin is maximizing their support. \u201cWe consistently contact moderators, saying here are best practices,\u201d says Moore. When the company sees hot spots in disaster zones\u2014political, environmental, or otherwise\u2014they reach out to see how to make the app work best for the circumstances.Sometimes that support is as simple as passing on best practices for maintaining anonymity, or getting in touch with aid groups when Zello hears reports that donations have been hijacked before they could be delivered, according to Moore. But the most important way Zello supports politically oppressed people is by making sure Zello is available at all\u2014a lesson it learned in 2014.Back then, as the Venezuelan government saw people flock to Zello to share information and help coordinate the riots and protests that were erupting, they blocked the app. \u201cThe government-controlled service providers were ordered to block Zello,\" says Moore. \"But they did that in a relatively crude way\u2014by blocking IP addresses.\u201d The company responded by IP hopping, essentially changing Zello\u2019s IP address to a new one every time it got blocked. \u201cWe had very good help from the tech community within Venezuela,\u201d the CEO adds. Quickly, Zello created a program that would automatically detect when an IP address was blocked and immediately switch to another.The IP-hopping program would come in handy. In 2017, Russia told Zello it would need to register with the government to operate in the country legally. \u201cEssentially they said \u2018Make all this communication available for our use,\u2019 and we said \u2018Sorry, of course we can\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d recalls Moore, saying that because the app was encrypted, it was technically impossible to turn over everything that Russia wanted anyway. At that point, Russia began blocking Zello\u2019s IP addresses, and Zello started hopping.Though this kept Zello available in the country, it caused all sorts of problems for the IP hosting services Zello used, chief among them Amazon Web Services. Since Zello wasn\u2019t the only service using certain IP addresses, when the Russian government blocked Zello, it blocked other, unrelated AWS customers too. As Zello hopped and more addresses got blocked, more services using AWS were taken offline. Amazon told Zello to knock it off.\u201cAmazon came back to us and said that it was against their policy,\u201d Moore says. \u201cOur argument to them was that Amazon was a tool of the Russian government, who was using Amazon to censor their people.\u201d Amazon did not agree, according to the Zello CEO, and argued that it had no political agenda but needed activity that was hurting its other customers to stop. (Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.) Moore found the response was similar at other hosting services Zello could switch to, such as Google; Zello still uses AWS today.SIGN UP TODAYGet the Backchannel newsletter for the best features and investigations on WIRED.Privacy advocates have criticized the role internet infrastructure firms can play in government censorship. \u201cWhen the profitable answer is for a software giant to acquiesce to censors' demands, how long can internet freedom last?\u201d wrote Bruce Schneier after Russia pulled the same thing with encrypted messaging app Telegram one year later.Moore says that neither the Russian nor the Venezuelan government blocks Zello\u2019s IP addresses anymore, but isn\u2019t sure why: \u201c[The Russians] sort of forgot about us and so Zello continues to operate there.\u201d But the company still recommends people use a VPN to access it. That\u2019s what people in Venezuela do, according to Mar\u00eda, since Zello is blocked in app stores there. Venezuelans hear about Zello and her channel through word of mouth, and also from social media; the channel has Twitter, Instagram, and SoundCloud accounts.Like any communication platform, Zello can be used for better or for worse. As WIRED reported last year, the app has taken heat for a more hands-off approach toward terrorist groups like ISIS. At the time, Moore admitted that the company needed to do a better job. Since then, Zello removed its trending channels portal, which Moore acknowledges had encouraged bad behavior, turning Zello into a sort of \u201cCB radio Twitter,\u201d as he put it. Zello has also joined the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, which Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube formed in 2017. In addition, the company has committed to the Tech Against Terrorism pledge, created by the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee to help smaller tech companies counter extremism on their platforms.But if terrorists represent the worst of what can be done on an app like Zello, Mar\u00eda and her fellow Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos moderators represent the best.It hasn\u2019t been easy. Mar\u00eda\u2019s dedication to Venezuela, and to providing information and support to the people there through Zello, comes at a personal price. She has a family and a full-time job, though she can thankfully work from home. \u201cIt has been an issue for my marriage,\u201d Mar\u00eda notes. Her husband, who is from the US, at first objected to how much time she spent devoted to the channel. It was like part of her was always somewhere else, somewhere falling apart. He asked her to stop, or at least cut down. \u201cI remember crying and telling my husband, \u2018You don\u2019t understand how I feel that I can help a little bit my family and my people. This is important to me. Don\u2019t make me not do this,\u2019\u201d she says.Mar\u00eda and her team hear all the time from Venezuelans telling them that without Venezuela Hasta Los Tu\u00e9tanos they\u2019d be in darkness. \u201cSometimes I felt so overwhelmed and I felt like we are never going to get out of this and I want to quit,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd then I think about the people of the channel who will not get news or hope if I stop and I truly feel that I have a responsibility.\u201dMore Great WIRED StoriesAirbnb\u2019s \u201cguerrilla war\u201d against local governmentsChange your Facebook password right nowWith Stadia, Google's gaming dreams head for the cloudA more humane livestock industry, thanks to CrisprFor gig workers, client interactions can get \u2026 weird\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

            "text": "\u201cRight to repair just basically says, \u2018Hey guys, you got to make the information and the parts available.\u2019\u201d \u2014Elizabeth Warren, on All In With Chris Hayes, March 27, 2019Our work to help people fix their stuff reached a milestone last week, when US senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massa\u00adchusetts) called for Right to Repair to support farmers struggling with growing antitrust issues in agriculture.WIRED OPINIONABOUTNathan Proctor (@nProctor) is director of the Right to Repair Campaign for US PIRG, an advocacy organization.Warren has raised Right to Repair to a new level of national prominence. It\u2019s a big moment for those of us who have been sounding the alarm on how companies have been placing obstacles in the way of repair, and the resulting hassle, cost and environmental damage.I would like to claim that somehow our organizing efforts (led by iFixit, Repair.org and US PIRG) brought us to this moment, but the best organizing done to support Right to Repair is done by our opponents. When they put their customers through the wringer to get stuff fixed, it creates an enthusiasm beyond what even the most compelling opinion column could produce.Frankly, if you hear the stories from people struggling to deal with the deluge of unfixable products, you understand why there have been 20 states with active Right to Repair bills so far in 2019. If you ask me, these stories are why the issue has entered the national policy debate.Stories like what happened to Nebraska farmer Kyle Schwarting, whose John Deere combine malfunctioned and couldn\u2019t be fixed by Schwarting himself\u2014because the equipment was designed with a software lock that only an authorized John Deere service technician could access. Schwarting could have taken the machine to an official John Deere shop, but that would mean paying thousands of dollars to load the tractor on a flatbed truck and haul it to the dealership, all while the window for harvest was closing.So yeah, Kyle Schwarting wants a right to repair his combine. To save his livelihood, he had to hack the software, something the US Office of Copyright decided he had every right to do.In a move that further frustrated its customers, John Deere argued to the Copyright Office against that right, claiming that people like Schwarting don\u2019t fully own the tractors they have bought; they use the equipment under \u201can implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle.\u201dTom Schwarz, fifth-generation farmer and Right to Repair advocate, laughed at this suggestion, saying in an On Point radio segment where we appeared together: \u201cWe pay personal property taxes on all our equipment, so when my wife sits down \u2026 and writes those checks out, I haven\u2019t noticed John Deere putting any money into that.\u201dHaving a company you purchased a $500,000 piece of equipment from argue that you don\u2019t really own the equipment has the effect of recruiting a few new Right to Repair supporters.Related StoriesNathan ProctorCorporations Are Co-Opting Right-to-RepairKyle WiensJohn Deere Just Swindled Farmers out of Their Right to RepairBrian BarrettApple Will Keep Throttling iPhones With Old Batteries. Here's How to Stop ItIt's not only farmers who have repair horror stories. Many of us know the story of BatteryGate or ThrottleGate\u2014which resulted in quite a few Right to Repair converts. In December 2017, at the height of holiday shopping season, Apple users discovered that a software update was throttling phones\u2019 processors if it detected the battery was worn down. After some public blowback, Apple offered to replace those older batteries at a reduced price at Apple stores. But with such high demand, long waiting lists formed. Some customers faced an additional obstacle: They lived hours away from the nearest Apple store.Meanwhile, Apple does not make its original replacement batteries available to anyone but their small number of authorized locations. If you didn\u2019t want to wait a few months to get a phone that wasn\u2019t slow and buggy, you would have to swap the battery out with a replacement part not made by Apple.Until Apple reversed its policy just a few weeks ago, replacing the battery with a third-party substitute would result in Apple refusing to service the phone entirely. Our report, \u201cRecharge Repair,\u201d found that third-party shops still saw a 37 percent increase in battery replacements in the five weeks after the scandal broke\u2014because people just wanted their phones fixed.After that mess, Right to Repair saw a pretty big surge in support.Every day, I hear stories about a dishwasher that died right after the warranty ended, or people getting quoted a repair cost that\u2019s more than replacing the whole appliance or device. Device after device, hassle after hassle. (Got your own story? You can share it here.)All that unfixable stuff doesn\u2019t disappear when we are forced to replace it. It piles up. Electronic waste is the fastest growing part of our waste stream. It is often toxic and poses grave health risks. The increase in this kind of waste is fed both by the growing number of products with electronics in them and the shrinking lifespan of those products. A 2015 study found that \u201cthe proportion of all units sold to replace a defective appliance grew from 3.5% in 2004 to 8.3% in 2012, in what [researchers] deemed a \u2018remarkable\u2019 increase.\u201dI\u2019m excited to see Right to Repair become a national issue and part of a major candidate\u2019s platform. And its resonance for consumers won\u2019t go away until companies stop selling us easily breakable stuff\u2014and then trying to block us from fixing it.Hey guys, just give us the parts and information so we can fix stuff. If it seems like too much to ask, we can stick to demanding it.More Great WIRED StoriesWant Apple Card\u2019s security benefits? Just use Apple PayCan AI be a fair judge in court?

            "text": "A report on Thursday from a British government oversight group found that Chinese telecom-equipment maker Huawei has basic but deeply problematic flaws in its product code that create security risks. The shortcomings, many of which Huawei had previously promised to improve, stem from issues with its software development processes, according to the report. The findings come amid a concerted Trump administration effort to ban Huawei products around the world (particularly in 5G wireless networks), because of concerns that Huawei devices are controlled by the Chinese government or that Huawei would take orders from Beijing to undermine its security protections if asked.Though the geopolitical discourse has gotten heated, the report concluded that the flaws in Huawei's code are related to \"basic engineering competence and cyber security hygiene\" and could be exploited by anyone. The report does not conclude that the bugs are intentional backdoors created for the Chinese government. Such broad exposure is still problematic\u2014it could be exploited as well by US espionage agencies and the rest of the Five Eyes, but that\u2019s of less concern to the White House.\"There is no backdoor, because Huawei doesn\u2019t need a backdoor. It has a front door,\" says James Lewis, a former State Department official and director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Technology and Public Policy Program. \"The UK government has lots of problems with Chinese hacking. It\u2019s not like there are Swedish hackers breaking in to steal British intellectual property every week. If Huawei was a Swedish company or a Brazilian company or something it wouldn\u2019t be having these troubles. But it's seen as a tool of a very aggressive Chinese government.\"US telecom companies have largely eschewed Huawei since a 2012 Congressional report about the national security threat potentially posed by the company's products. And President Trump has been mulling an Executive Order to fully ban the company's equipment. But network operators in other countries, including the UK, have worked to safely incorporate Huawei's effective, low cost wireless equipment. The UK even established the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre in 2010 to audit Huawei hardware and software as it left the company's factories before shipping to the US.It was that center\u2019s oversight board that produced Thursday's report. The document noted the difficulty of even establishing whether the code the group audited is actually the same as the code running in Huawei products.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to 5GTo a degree, the challenge of assessing risk in Huawei's products relates to larger industry issues of how to accurately vet the integrity of proprietary software. Some of the systemic security vulnerabilities disclosed in the report are painfully basic, but security analysts note that this type of audit would likely reveal embarrassing oversights in most companies' products\u2014even if Huawei\u2019s faults are more egregious.\"Companies obviously prefer not to receive security audits calling out such things, that's why they have internal security standards and quality assurance,\" says Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity adviser and research associate at the University of Oxford's Center for Technology and Global Affairs.Though the report doesn't conclude that Huawei products include nefarious backdoors, the extent of the problems it uncovers will still likely buoy the White House's efforts to steer the US and its allies away from Huawei. The UK has attempted to safely incorporate Huawei's products into its telecom infrastructure for almost a decade, but the report indicates that the exposure may be too much for the country to mitigate on its own.\"The UK has long tried to decouple the trust and espionage matters from the technical side, arguing that the technical risk is manageable and that there's always some risk anyway,\" Olejnik says. \"But the report seems to undermine past assurances of the UK's ability to manage the Huawei risk.\"For its part, Huawei maintains that it is working to strengthen the security protections in its engineering workflow and says that it supports collaboration between industry and international regulators to ensure robust security in telecom networks around the world. \"The 2019 HCSEC Oversight Board Report details some concerns about Huawei's software engineering capabilities,\" the company said in a statement on Thursday. \"The issues identified ... provide vital input for the ongoing transformation of our software engineering capabilities.\" The company has pledged to invest $2 billion in engineering improvements.After years of promises, though, observers say it is difficult to believe that Huawei will prioritize making significant changes. Especially if the company sees benefits to being buggy-by-design.More Great WIRED StoriesThe best gear and apps to have (or not have) a babyKnock around a goat carcass with these buzkashi playersEverything you need to know about cannabisAirbnb\u2019s \u201cguerrilla war\u201d against local governmentsA read/write metaphor is a flawed way to talk about DNA\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

            "text": "In old spy novels, when two secret agents need to communicate with each other out in the field, one of them often leaves a document in an assigned place\u2014tucked in the hollow of a tree trunk or between the pages of a certain library book. Once the first agent has safely vacated the scene, the second one moves in to fetch it.This maneuver\u2014called a dead drop\u2014may seem straight\u00adforward. But if you think about it, there\u2019s a serious hitch: Somehow, the location of the dead drop has to be pre\u00adarranged.Related StoriesZeynep TufekciShouldn\u2019t We All Have Seamless Micropayments By Now?Tom SimoniteThis US Firm Wants to Help Build China\u2019s Surveillance StateLily Hay NewmanThe Privacy Battle to Save Google From ItselfThis isn\u2019t just a problem with the genre conventions of spy thrillers. For thousands of years, this was, in fact, a fundamental flaw in human communication. Whether you were Caesar, Napoleon, or a spy using shortwave radio during the Cold War, if you wanted to communicate secretly in the future, you had to first manage to communicate secretly in the past. And arranging that moment of first contact between two agents was always dangerous, difficult, and prone to interception.Then in 1976, two privacy-oriented computer scientists, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, cracked this age-old problem with an idea called public key cryptography. They came up with an ingenious protocol that involved the use of one-way functions\u2014mathematical calculations that are easy to solve in one direction but very, very difficult in the other. (It\u2019s easy to multiply two large prime numbers together to get a very large result, but it\u2019s super hard to work backward to find those original two numbers\u2014unless you own billions of dollars worth of supercomputers. Hi, NSA!) Here\u2019s how it most often works in practice: One person, let\u2019s call her Alice, creates a private key, which gets fed through an algorithm using one-way math functions to create a public key. After that, anyone can send an encrypted message to Alice, and only she will be able to unlock it easily.The implications of this breakthrough have been vast. For most of human history, if anyone wanted to communicate secretly, they had to engage in a bunch of perilous, time-consuming, and expensive spycraft. That was the trade-off, the cost of doing business. Public key cryptography dramatically changed that. All of a sudden, in one swift revolutionary moment, \u00adpeople could communicate secretly ab initio\u2014not only spies, but everybody. And it was fairly painless. Just think of all the confidential exchanges you conduct with strangers online: Every time you log in to a bank account or shopping site, browse an \u201chttps\u201d web page, or send a digital signature, you\u2019re relying on a user-friendly version of private key cryptography. Diffie and Hellman didn\u2019t just render the dead drop obsolete; they made the internet as we know it possible.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Artificial IntelligenceNow consider another, more modern phenomenon that needs to be made obsolete\u2014a data transaction that is very different from a dead drop but also terribly flawed.Today, if you\u2019re a company that benefits from machine learning, chances are that, somewhere along the line, you\u2019ve engaged in a bunch of nightmarish surveillance. Right now that\u2019s just the cost of doing business with this technology. Machine learning, as you may have heard, is a computational method that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in lots and lots of data until, eventually, they can answer questions, make predictions, and solve problems. For example, Google Translate works by chewing through billions of words of existing translated text\u2014its \u201ctraining corpus\u201d\u2014to generate the most probable correct translation. The results aren\u2019t perfect, but they can be uncannily effective.They\u2019re effective enough, anyway, that the rush to capitalize on this form of AI has set off a feeding frenzy. Companies are collecting, scraping, mining, and buying every scintilla of data they can get their hands on. Unscrupulous third parties are doing even worse. Wherever lots of data is stored, there\u2019s a good chance it will be breached, pilfered, sold, hacked, and eventually fed into machine-learning protocols, sometimes for malevolent purposes. The technology\u2019s success is simultaneously a privacy-\u00adviolating disaster for society.We need a new breakthrough in encryption, one that fundamentally changes the rotten trade-off we now make between privacy and AI.At the same time, other pitfalls with today\u2019s machine learning hold it back from being useful where it might really help. For instance, it\u2019s a challenge right now for responsible actors to use machine learning in scenarios where it\u2019s not legally possible or ethically desirable to share underlying data. Say two hospitals each have a corpus of data about patient outcomes after initial Pap smears\u2014a notoriously difficult diagnostic test for cervical cancer. Machine learning has shown some real promise at being able to read these tests. It might be highly beneficial to train an algorithm on the whole data set, but that would require bringing it all together somehow. Hospitals may not be legally allowed to share patient information. Their hands are tied.So how do we preserve\u2014and even expand\u2014the benefits of machine learning while also reconciling it with basic standards of confidentiality? We need some new breakthroughs that fundamentally change the rotten trade-off we now make between privacy and AI. The good news is that there\u2019s a growing research effort in what\u2019s called \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d machine learning. Academics are trying to develop algorithms that can operate on encrypted data, which means they wouldn\u2019t need to access anyone\u2019s data directly. Other researchers are figuring out ways to combine insights from different machine-\u00adlearning models without needing to merge all their underlying data. Companies like Apple, \u00adGoogle, and Microsoft already have teams working on such projects.SIGN UP TODAYSign up for the Daily newsletter and never miss the best of WIRED.With effective regulation, those teams would grow faster. We should ban the spurious and excessive data collection that is currently the norm\u2014not only to put a stop to obviously abusive practices, but also to speed innovation. When faced with new regulatory barriers, companies and researchers will pour effort into developing new compliant ways to have their cake.With any luck, their breakthroughs will make it newly possible for, say, medical researchers to use machine learning on sensitive, private data sets\u2014and for the rest of us to enjoy the perks of ubiquitous AI without having our privacy savaged.

The apps were disguised as offering promotions from cell phone providers, but installed malware to steal data from devices and also left phones vulnerable to additional hacking. Legal experts and law enforcement sources told Motherboard that the apps appear to have flouted Italian laws permitting the use of spyware in certain circumstances. After being alerted by the researchers, Google took the apps off the Play Store. The company says it found 25 different versions of the spyware dating back to 2016, and that fewer than 1,000 Italians were affected. The specifics of the spyware are alarming, but there\u2019s a larger takeaway from the story, too. As Motherboard writes, \u201cThis new case once again highlights the limits of Google\u2019s filters that are intended to prevent malware from slipping onto the Play Store.\u201dRussia Demands VPNs Block \u2018Banned\u2019 SitesRoskomnadzor, Russia\u2019s media and telecom regulator, has notified 10 popular VPNs that they must start blocking sites on the government blacklist. According to TorrentFreak, the notice cites a 2017 law requiring services like VPNs to enforce the blacklist; the companies have 30 days to comply or risk getting blocked themselves. Since that law was passed, the VPNs have demurred, continuing to host the banned sites, but now experts are not sure what will happens if the companies refuse this time. One of the VPNs, TorGuard, told TorrentFreak it had already shut down its Russian operations and left the country in response to the notices, which also demanded the company hand over information on its business practices.Dark-Web Marketplace to Shut DownIn what may mark the end of an era, the dark-web marketplace Dream Market announced this week that it\u2019s shutting down on April 30. Dream Market has been around since 2013. It emerged as a dark-web leader after Silk Road shut down, followed shortly by its three biggest competitors. But its time on top would be brief. The news of the shutdown broke on the same day that law enforcement announced major arrests for dark-web drug trafficking. As ZDNet reports, that has worried Dream Market users and observers, who fear the site may have been compromised , and that any activity that takes place on there in its final month may be part of a honeypot operation. If it were true, it wouldn\u2019t be the first sting in the dark-web world.Microsoft Takes on Iranian HackersIranian hacking group Phosphorus has 99 problems, and Microsoft is all of them. The company announced on Wednesday that it had taken down over 99 domains operated by the nation-state hackers. Microsoft followed a playbook it has honed over 15 similar cases: It challenged Phosphorus in a US civil court, arguing that it was illegal for the group to mimic Microsoft websites in order to attack people. The court ruled in Microsoft\u2019s favor and gave the company the right to seize the domains. Microsoft\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit and its Intelligence Center have been tracking the group since 2013, according to its announcement. The company believes the group was using the sites to spear-phish for passwords, contact information, or even control of people\u2019s computers.More Great WIRED StoriesHow much prenatal genetic info do you really want?On the trail of the robocall kingThe real choice you make subscribing to Apple servicesThe mathematical history of a perfect color combinationFor gig workers, client interactions can get \u2026 weird\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

            "text": "In December, Mastercard announced that it was working to develop an international digital identity scheme which could be used as a flexible verifier for financial transactions, government interactions, or online services. The idea of a secure, decentralized, universal ID has become a sort of holy grail in the age of rapid digital interactions and rampant identity fraud.Mastercard's initial announcement was met with some skepticism from privacy-minded observers. Now, the company is releasing more details in a new 24-page report on how its platform will be set up and what the tool will offer. But you still can't try it yet.Mastercard envisions a platform in which consumers have control of their identity information and it is stored locally on their devices, rather than in a centralized system that Mastercard would need to defend. The ID would be set up through a bank or other participating institution that already holds identity information about the individual. And people would manage their enrollment and interact with their universal ID through that institution's secure mobile app.\"It's a consumer-centric model for digital identity that gives consumers control,\" says Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions at Mastercard. \"It will securely bind a person\u2019s identity to their smartphone or any other device, and the idea is that this will unlock new and enhanced experiences for people as they interact with businesses and service providers.\"Lily Hay Newman covers information security, digital privacy, and hacking for WIRED.Mastercard says that the project puts a strong emphasis on privacy rights, both so that consumers feel more in control and to cut down on the amount of data they share (whether they realize it or not) that contributes to identity theft in current digital systems. Institutions that offer the ID and those that use it to verify transactions (like say, car rental companies or governments) would pay Mastercard to manage and oversee this verification network.Here's how the system is meant to work: You initiate the creation of a Mastercard ID at your bank or other institution that participates in the program and already holds some of your sensitive data. That organization would begin to combine your identification documents into what Mastercard calls a \"data collage\" or \"data package.\" You can enrich this package by feeding in other points of identification, and then all of this is churned up into a sort of digital verification token, which is then stored on your phone. This way you aren't literally storing PDFs of your birth certificate and driver's license on your device. And Mastercard doesn't ever see or hold a copy of any of these documents, nor does it hold everyone's tokens in a central repository that could be breached.The identity platform will use elements of the cryptographic concept known as a \u201czero-knowledge proof,\u201d a mathematical approach to prove that a statement is true without directly evaluating the information that proves it. For example, the universal ID could allow someone to prove that they are old enough to buy alcohol under a given country's laws without having to share their specific age. Or they could prove that they have a valid passport that meets set requirements without a hotel needing to know and store their passport number. These types of controls could significantly cut down on the troves of personal information hackers can grab in data breaches, and could even help cut down on shady data brokering among corporate third parties.The ID scheme was also developed, Bhalla says, with humanitarian goals in mind. The system could potentially bring an identification option to the roughly 1 billion people around the world (by Mastercard's estimation) who don't have adequate documentation, such as refugees and those who lack government recognition for other reasons. It is unclear, though, exactly how Mastercard's system would establish factual information about people, such as their age, if they do not have an existing relationship with a bank or other institution.Mastercard's platform claims to incorporate all the elements you might expect of a digital corporate offering in 2019, including biometric authentication, strong data encryption, and a distributed ledger (blockchain!) that keeps data decentralized. But the company still hasn't released detailed technical documentation of what specifically will underly the system. When Mastercard announced the project in December, it named Microsoft as a partner and said that the identity platform would be \"powered\" by Microsoft's Azure cloud. While Mastercard's press release Tuesday notes the relationship in passing, the report itself makes no mention of Microsoft, and Microsoft did not return a request from WIRED for comment about its involvement.Access to robust identification is an uncontroversial idea in theory, but it is extremely difficult to provide in practice. And privacy advocates have warned that there are many ways for even the most well-intentioned digital identity schemes to turn into dangerous and invasive surveillance apparatuses. And these types of platforms need to be extensively and independently vetted to ensure their security.\"One of the hard problems is identity proofing,\" says Jim Fenton, an independent identity privacy and security consultant, who followed Mastercard's initial announcement. \"How can you be sure that an online identity is associated with a specific individual? I'd like to know how they plan on identity proofing billions of people securely.\"Plus, even if Mastercard's system is robust, it will need buy-in from institutions around the world to truly become a useful form of ID. Mastercard says it is in talks with banks and other partners about the project, though it isn't naming any of those groups yet.A trustworthy, broadly useful digital identity would be immensely valuable for people around the world, but in practice, it's thorny to actually set one up. And Mastercard's offering will need to gain significant traction to actually end up on your phone.More Great WIRED StoriesAirbnb\u2019s \u201cguerrilla war\u201d against local governmentsChange your Facebook password right nowWith Stadia, Google's gaming dreams head for the cloudA more humane livestock industry, thanks to CrisprFor gig workers, client interactions can get \u2026 weird\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

            "text": "Today's news that hackers put backdoors into thousands of Asus computers using the company's own software update platform is a reminder of why supply-chain compromises are one of the scariest digital attacks out there.Attackers compromised Asus\u2019s Live Update tool to distribute malware to almost 1 million customers last year, according to initial findings researchers at the threat intelligence firm Kaspersky Lab disclosed Monday. The news was first reported by Motherboard. Asus machines accepted the tainted software because the attackers were able to sign it with a real Asus certificate (used to verify the legitimacy and trustworthiness of new code). Though the scope of the attack is broad, the hackers seem to have been seeking out a select 600 computers to target more deeply in a second-stage attack.The HackKaspersky calls the attack ShadowHammer, indicating a possible link to ShadowPad malware used in some other major software supply-chain attacks. The hackers took a real Asus update from 2015 and subtly modified it before pushing it out to Asus customers sometime in the second half of 2018. Kaspersky discovered the attack on Asus in January and disclosed it to the company on January 31. Kaspersky says its researchers met with Asus a few times and the company seems to be in the process of investigating the incident, cleaning up its systems, and establishing new defenses.Asus did not begin notifying its customers about the situation until Kaspersky went public with the findings. \"A small number of devices have been implanted with malicious code through a sophisticated attack on our Live Update servers in an attempt to target a very small and specific user group. ASUS customer service has been reaching out to affected users and providing assistance to ensure that the security risks are removed,\" the company wrote in a statement on Tuesday. \"ASUS has also implemented a fix in the latest version (ver. 3.6.8) of the Live Update software, introduced multiple security verification mechanisms to prevent any malicious manipulation in the form of software updates or other means, and implemented an enhanced end-to-end encryption mechanism. At the same time, we have also updated and strengthened our server-to-end-user software architecture to prevent similar attacks from happening in the future.\"Lily Hay Newman covers information security, digital privacy, and hacking for WIRED.Software supply-chain attacks are insidious, because once hackers establish the ability to create platform updates that appear to be legitimate, they can capitalize on the product's distribution base to spread their malware quickly and widely. In the case of the Asus incident, attackers were targeting more than 600 machines in particular. They took advantage of Asus' reach to do a big sweep for as many of them as possible.\"Like any other supply-chain attack, this is very opportunistic,\" says Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky's global research and analysis team. \"You cast a wide net to try to catch everything and then handpick what you're looking for.\"Every digital device has a unique identifier called a MAC address, and the Asus malware was programmed to check the addresses of the devices it infected. For the hundreds of thousands of Asus customers whose devices weren\u2019t on the hackers' hit list, the malware would have no effect; it wasn\u2019t programmed to be able to do anything else. If it was running on a targeted machine, however, it was programmed to phone home to a malicious server and download the second-stage payload to carry out a deeper attack.For now, Kaspersky says it doesn't have a full picture of what the attackers were doing on the specially targeted machines.Who\u2019s AffectedKaspersky estimates that the malware was distributed to about 1 million machines in total. Most Asus users won\u2019t experience any long-term effects of the attack, but it remains to be seen what exactly the impacts were for people who own any of the 600 targeted machines.The list of roughly 600 target devices that the malware was looking for mostly includes Asus machines\u2014as you would expect for malware distributed through that manufacturer. But Raiu notes that some of the MAC addresses in the list have prefixes indicating that they are not Asus devices and are made by another manufacturer. It's unclear why these non-Asus MAC addresses were included in the list; perhaps they represent a larger sample of the attackers' total wish list.Kaspersky has created a downloadable tool and an online portal that you can use to check whether your devices' MAC addresses were on the target list. The researchers hope that this will help them connect with victims of the more targeted attack, so they can find out more about what the hackers were after and what the targeted victims have in common, if anything. On Tuesday, Asus also released a diagnostic tool for its users.How Bad Is ThisTainted updates in otherwise legitimate software platforms have already wreaked havoc in big incidents like the May 2017 NotPetya outbreak and the June 2017 CCleaner compromise. Kaspersky\u2019s Raiu says that the firm suspects the Asus incident is connected to a series of mostly thwarted 2017 ShadowPad attacks as well as the successful use of ShadowPad in the CCleaner compromise. But the link isn\u2019t definite yet.Raiu adds the group that may be behind all of these attacks, known as Barium, rewrites tools for every large attack so scanners can\u2019t detect them by looking for its old code signatures. But Kaspersky researchers see similarities in the way the Asus backdoor, the CCleaner backdoor, and other instances of ShadowPad were conceptually designed. They also look for other consistent tells the group uses in its code across different campaigns, though Kaspersky doesn\u2019t reveal details of these indicators. Additionally, the CCleaner attack also cast a wide net in looking for a smaller population of specific targets.\u201cWhat is absolutely amazing about these guys is they change the shell code from one attack to the other,\u201d Raiu notes. \u201cThe Asus case is different from every other case that we have seen so far.\u201dThe sinister truth that a supply-chain compromise could happen to any company feels a lot more real when one hits a computer maker as big as Asus.Updated March 26, 2019 10:00am ET to include a public statement from Asus and information about a diagnostic tool it released. The company did not directly respond to WIRED's request for comment.More Great WIRED StoriesAirbnb\u2019s \u201cguerrilla war\u201d against local governmentsChange your Facebook password right nowWith Stadia, Google's gaming dreams head for the cloudA more humane livestock industry, thanks to CrisprFor gig workers, client interactions can get \u2026 weird\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?

            "text": "At a typically glitzy launch event in Cupertino on Monday, Apple debuted the Apple Card, a new credit card offered in collaboration with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard. Apple claims it will resolve many consumer frustrations with current credit cards: the card will be simple to sign up for, there won't be any fees, and it will be easy to redeem rewards. The company also firmly asserts that Apple Card \u201ctransforms the entire credit card experience by \u2026 providing a new level of privacy and security.\u201dBut you don't need to wait until Apple Card comes out this summer to experience its touted security features. All you need to do is use Apple Pay and whatever credit card you already own.\"Nothing really changes with the Apple Card,\" says Avivah Litan, vice president of research at the analysis and advisory firm Gartner. \"It's pretty genius actually. They already have the whole Apple Pay infrastructure built and tremendous adoption now across the world, so this is a competitive move.\"Lily Hay Newman covers information security, digital privacy, and hacking for WIRED.When you add a credit card to Apple Wallet to use with Apple Pay, whether it's an Apple Card or another credit card, the service cryptographically morphs the credit card number and other details into a unique card identity that is stored in Apple's \"secure element\" for added protection. Completing a transaction through Apple Pay then requires that unique identifier and a one-time-use security code, along with additional biometric verification from you via FaceID or TouchID. This way, your real credit card number is never even transmitted for the transaction, and a fraudster would need the one-time transaction code and your face or fingerprint to make unauthorized charges. These same security benefits will extend to Apple Card.Though there have been some examples of fraud on Apple Pay since its launch in 2014, security advocates generally consider these protections to be a solid improvement over typical credit card transactions. But in cases where Apple Pay isn't an option, the Apple Card is, in terms of protections, just that\u2014a typical credit card.The physical card is exactly the minimalist, etched titanium slice you would expect from Apple, and it takes a good security step by displaying only your name, without a card or CVV number. But if you use the card at a store for a regular chip transaction, it seems to function like any other credit card. There's no tech in the card itself; it can't complete contactless payments. The card also appears, based on photos from Apple's announcement, to have a magnetic strip on the back, which comes with its own set of security woes. And though the card number isn't physically displayed, you can access it in Apple Wallet and use it to make online purchases just as you would with any other credit card. Apple would prefer that you do online transactions with Apple Pay anyway, but if you don't there aren't any additional special attributes of Apple Card protecting you.LEARN MOREThe WIRED Guide to Online ShoppingAnd Apple's arrangement with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard\u2014as issuing bank and payment network, respectively\u2014is a standard setup for a branded card.\"In general for all merchants this is going to be treated as another Mastercard transaction and it\u2019s going to follow all of those rules,\" says John Drechny, CEO of the Merchant Advisory Group, an independent industry body. \"And if merchants accept the card online they\u2019re still going to have the same liability arrangement with the payment network. I don't believe it will be any different than a normal co-branded deal.\"As is the case with any other credit card, the bank and the payment network involved in routing and executing transactions will have normal data access. Which isn't all bad. Banks analyze consumer financial data to spot patterns and attempt to reduce fraud. They just also typically share and sell this data for other purposes.That's one area where Apple Card could prove to stand out, and would be in line with the company's emphasis on data privacy. Apple noted in its announcement that \"Goldman Sachs will never share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or advertising.\" Apple did not make mention of whether Mastercard has agreed not to share or sell user data, and did not return a request from WIRED for comment.As for Apple itself, the company says that it won't have access to any user transaction data or purchasing information. Apple Card features meant to help users track their spending and analyze statement information will all be populated locally on users' devices, not on Apple servers.\"Apple gets the best of both worlds by becoming a card issuer and partnering with a bank,\" Gartner's Litan says of Apple's decision to box itself out of accessing user data. \"They can keep their nose clean.\"Overall, Apple's efforts to increase Apple Pay usage are commendable from a security and anti-fraud standpoint. And it's clear that the purpose of Apple Card is to drive adoption and use of Apple Pay. But the Apple Card itself is a little more run of the mill.More Great WIRED StoriesIt's either the best time or the worst time to have a babyThe real choice you make subscribing to Apple servicesThe mathematical history of a perfect color combinationChange your Facebook password right nowFor gig workers, client interactions can get \u2026 weird\ud83d\udc40 Looking for the latest gadgets?
